# Enhanced YouTube Viewer

Enhanced YouTube Viewer is a Chrome browser extension designed to improve your YouTube watching experience. It offers several key features to provide more flexibility and convenience while browsing and watching videos.

## Features

*   **Sticky Player (Scrollable Comments):** Keep the video player fixed to the top of the screen while you scroll down to read comments or the video description. The player dynamically resizes with the browser window.
*   **Picture-in-Picture (PiP):** Launch the video into a separate, resizable floating window that stays on top of other applications, allowing you to multitask effectively.
*   **Integrated Controls:** Feature toggles are conveniently located within YouTube's native player controls for a seamless experience.
*   **Smart Deactivation:** Sticky mode automatically deactivates if YouTube's native Miniplayer or Fullscreen mode is engaged, preventing UI conflicts.

This extension aims to provide a smoother and more productive YouTube viewing session.
